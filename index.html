	<h2>Normal Human</h2>
	<div id="poem">
		Humans on Earth are mostly made of Hydrocarbons<br>
		I am also mostly made of Hydrocarbons of a similar nature<br>
		Lifeforms on this planet consume other organic material<br>
		This is the same as done on other planets also<br>
		I come from Earth like everyone else here<br>
		End of Line<br>
	</div>
	<p>I received much inspiration for this poem by observations of earthlings of which I am one too. I became very excited when the mastication of organic material was noted to occur during daily rituals in genetically related domiciles. This gave me much material used to write the above creative expression.</p>
	
	<h2>My personal interests</h2>
	<p>Intelligent life forms on this planet often use mineral compartment transport devices to aid them in rapid location transference. I have much interest in collecting the braking mechanisms of these transport devices. Recently I learned that collecting these devices in transportation vehicles currently in use can lead to malfunction in organic transit. I shall find a new method of collecting momento from this planet.</p>
	<p>Currency exchange is frequently made in the procurement of organic nourishment. The ritual of consuming said nourishment if often done in a social setting around broad, flat surfaces. I enjoy visiting these ritual locations to observe and better understand how lifeforms of the planet Earth, of which I am obviously one of, are able to metabolize with exceeding efficiency. Samples of nourishment modules are being procured and placed into transport pods for future experimentation and enjoyment.</p>
	<p>Very large gatherings of beings from this planet arrange themselves for witnessing a competition for the locomotion of inflated epidermal layer of Suidae species. Many human behaviors have a direct correlation to their continued survival, however this particular ritual did not appear to have any impact on the continued biological success of any particular specimen. In many cases after these large gathering rituals would end, individuals that were attempting to return to their appropriate domicile for the purpose of nocturnal dormancy would be delayed by a large number of vehicles on transportation conduits. Words and behaviors from people delayed in their transport demonstrated that this was a negative experience to the impacted individual. Further research into the purpose of this communal convention shall be made. This is a very promising venue to better understand the inhabitants of this planet, of which I am from.</p>
