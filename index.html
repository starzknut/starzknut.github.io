	<h2>Normal Human</h2>
	<div id="poem">
		Humans on Earth are mostly made of Hydrocarbons<br>
		I am also mostly made of Hydrocarbons of a similar nature<br>
		Lifeforms on this planet consume other organic material<br>
		This is the same as done on other planets also<br>
		I come from Earth like everyone else here<br>
		End of Line<br>
	</div>
	<p>I received much inspiration for this poem by observations of earthlings of which I am one too. I became very excited when the mastication of organic material was noted to occur during daily rituals in genetically related domiciles. This gave me much material used to write the above creative expression.</p>
