	<div id="poem">
		Humans on Earth are mostly made of Hydrocarbons<br>
		I am also mostly made of Hydrocarbons of a similar nature<br>

		This is the same as done on other planets also<br>

	<p>I received much inspiration for this poem by observations of earthlings of which I am one too. I became very excited when the mastication of organic material was noted to occur during daily rituals in genetically related domiciles. This gave me much material used to write the above creative expression.</p>
	
	<h2>My personal interests</h2>
	<p>Intelligent life forms on this planet often use mineral compartment transport devices to aid them in rapid location transference. I have much interest in collecting the braking mechanisms of these transport devices. Recently I learned that collecting these devices in transportation vehicles currently in use can lead to malfunction in organic transit. I shall find a new method of collecting momentos from this planet.</p>
	<p>Currency exchange is frequently made in the procurement of organic nurishment. The ritual of consuming said nurishment if often done in a social setting around broad, flat surfaces. I enjoy visiting these ritual locations to observe and better understand how lifeforms of the planet Earth, of which I am obviously one of, are able to metabolise with exceeding efficiency. Samples of nurishment modules are being procured and placed into tranport pods for future experimentation and enjoyment.</p>
	<p>Very large gatherings of beings from this planet arrange themselves for witnessing a competition for the locamotion of inflated epidurmal layer of Suidae species. Many human behaviors have a direct coorelation to their  </p>
